<b>Features Added:</b>

•Simple UI Design for most of the screens excluding the map and favourite screen.

•Login and registration screens done as well as the code behind it.

•Application has been created and connected on Google Firebase.

•Currency converter code added.

•Safety Info functionality added.

•Basic Map added 

•Added profile functionality 

•Basic Location Permissions were added 



<b>Issues faced:</b>

•After adding implementations for currency converter I recieved error "Invoke-customs are only supported starting with Android O". This was then fixed (with the help of google) by "compileOptions" into the gradle. 



<b>Aspects to fix:</b>

•Upon user signup the app unfortunately does not take the user directly into the app but instead the user is forced to login first. There should also be a 'forgot password' feature so that the user has the ability to change their password via email.
